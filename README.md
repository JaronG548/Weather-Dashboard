# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The purpose of this webpage is to show a 5-Day Forecast of the City that the user inputs in the search box and thier history is logged. This would function with the help of a Weather API and lots of JavaScript to have it function properly. I was motivated to work on this project because it involved using a API with no starter code so this was a great challenge to overcome and learn from. I built this project to practice using APIs and to learn more about the JavaScript involved with that. This webpage solves a problem for people who want to know the weather for the week from a city of their choice. I learned that the JavaScript around the APIs can get complicated if you don't know the correct steps to call it and add functions to it.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

With the finished webpage you will be able to input your city of choice in the search-bar at the top left of the Webpage. You will then have your input history saved and see the Current weather for the day in a large box while the next five days will be shown in little boxees below that.
